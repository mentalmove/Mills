# Nine Men's Morris (Mills)

This project has two purposes:
- Being a playable game human vs. machine
- Being a demonstration of the **Model-View-ViewModel** design pattern with a hopefully meaningful use purpose

### Usage of PHP Browser Version (branch _PHP_)

- Install a web server, able to execute PHP files
- Download project into _www_ - folder of this web server (might also be named _htdocs_ or similar)
- Call [SERVER_ROOT]**/**[PROJECT_NAME]**/** in a browser of your choice

Compared to **Javascript Version**, machine logic is fast but dumb.
